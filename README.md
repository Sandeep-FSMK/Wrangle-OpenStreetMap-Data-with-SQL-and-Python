Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data with SQL and Python
I have chosen  Bangalore map data in https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data . Finally, I have used SQL as the data schema to complete your project.
